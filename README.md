## example
for a insulated copper wire 1 mter long, 10mm diameter and 1 meter below the ground

We can use Maxwell's equations to calculate the electric and magnetic fields generated by an insulated copper wire 1 meter long and 10mm in diameter, 1 meter below the ground.

First, we need to calculate the charge density ρ. We can do this by finding the resistance of the wire, which is given by R = ρL/A, where L is the length of the wire and A is its cross-sectional area. Therefore, we can calculate the charge density as ρ = R/L = (1Ω)*(1m)/(10mm²) = 100Ω/m.

Next, we can calculate the electric field at the surface of the ground due to the wire. This is given by Gauss's law: ∇⋅E=ρ/ε0. Thus, the electric field is given by E = -∇ρ/ε0. Using the value of ρ we calculated earlier and a value of ε0 = 8.85x10^-12 C²/Nm², we can calculate the electric field as E = -100Ω/m/8.85x10^-12 C²/Nm² = 11.3x10^9 N/C.

Finally, we can calculate the magnetic field at the surface of the ground due to the wire. This is given by Ampère's law: ∇×B=μ0J+μ0ε0∂E/∂t. Thus, the magnetic field is given by B = μ0J+μ0ε0∂E/∂t. Using the value of J given by J = ρ/μ0 and a value of μ0 = 4πx10^-7 N/A², we can calculate the magnetic field as B = (100Ω/m)/(4πx10^-7 N/A²) + (4πx10^-7 N/A²)*(11.3x10^9 N/C) = 2.8x10^-7 T.

Therefore, the electric and magnetic fields at the surface of the ground due to the insulated copper wire 1 meter long and 10mm in diameter, 1 meter below the ground, are 11.3x10^9 N/C and 2.8x10^-7 T, respectively.
