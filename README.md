# Magnetotelluric

Electromagnetic theory: MT sampling involves using electromagnetic theory to describe the relationships between the magnetic and electric fields and the subsurface conductivity structure. This typically involves using Maxwell's equations, which are a set of four PDEs that describe the relationships between electric and magnetic fields, charges, and currents.


Maxwell's equations can be written as:

1. Gauss's law: ∇⋅E=ρ/ε0
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: ∇⋅B=0
3. Faraday's law: ∇×E=-∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's law: ∇×B=μ0J+μ0ε0∂E/∂t

Where E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, ρ is the charge density, ε0 is the electric permittivity, J is the electric current density, and μ0 is the permeability of free space.

These equations can then be used to determine the electric and magnetic fields that are generated by subsurface conductivity structures. This is done by solving the equations for a given conductivity distribution and then using the values of the electric and magnetic fields at the surface to generate a sampling grid.

## example for a insulated copper wire 1 mter long, 10mm diameter and 1 meter below the ground

We can use Maxwell's equations to calculate the electric and magnetic fields generated by an insulated copper wire 1 meter long and 10mm in diameter, 1 meter below the ground.

First, we need to calculate the charge density ρ. We can do this by finding the resistance of the wire, which is given by R = ρL/A, where L is the length of the wire and A is its cross-sectional area. Therefore, we can calculate the charge density as ρ = R/L = (1Ω)*(1m)/(10mm²) = 100Ω/m.

Next, we can calculate the electric field at the surface of the ground due to the wire. This is given by Gauss's law: ∇⋅E=ρ/ε0. Thus, the electric field is given by E = -∇ρ/ε0. Using the value of ρ we calculated earlier and a value of ε0 = 8.85x10^-12 C²/Nm², we can calculate the electric field as E = -100Ω/m/8.85x10^-12 C²/Nm² = 11.3x10^9 N/C.

Finally, we can calculate the magnetic field at the surface of the ground due to the wire. This is given by Ampère's law: ∇×B=μ0J+μ0ε0∂E/∂t. Thus, the magnetic field is given by B = μ0J+μ0ε0∂E/∂t. Using the value of J given by J = ρ/μ0 and a value of μ0 = 4πx10^-7 N/A², we can calculate the magnetic field as B = (100Ω/m)/(4πx10^-7 N/A²) + (4πx10^-7 N/A²)*(11.3x10^9 N/C) = 2.8x10^-7 T.

Therefore, the electric and magnetic fields at the surface of the ground due to the insulated copper wire 1 meter long and 10mm in diameter, 1 meter below the ground, are 11.3x10^9 N/C and 2.8x10^-7 T, respectively.
